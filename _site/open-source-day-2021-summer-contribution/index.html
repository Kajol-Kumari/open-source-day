        <p>As part of the Contribution Track, you will contribute code to our partner open source software (OSS) projects. You will work in groups, where you’ll have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from experienced mentors, there to guide and help you make your OSS contribution.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have a “Choose your own adventure” option, where you have the opportunity to contribute code to projects led by women maintainers or to just any project in the OSS community.</p>

<p><strong>New to Open Source? Don’t worry! You will not be alone;</strong> We will guide you through finding issues that are suited for your skill level and there will be mentors ready to help you.</p>
